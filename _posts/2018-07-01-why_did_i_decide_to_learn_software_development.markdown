My intro to programming is a bit of a funny story - you see, I never meant to learn… 

At the start of my third year of high school, my timetable was complicated. A compulsory course I needed to take had a late start date. My guidance counselor needed me to be enrolled in any class until the compulsory course started. So I spoke with one of my favourite teachers and asked if I could be enrolled in his third period class just for two weeks. I promised to sit quietly, not make any fuss, and leave when the other course started up. 

As it happened, his course was level two of programming in C++. Back in the early 2000's, learning to code was rather rare. I didn't know a thing about programming. This would have been problematic, since level one of C++ was a prerequisite, but my teacher and counselor made an exception since I had no intention of staying in the class.   

I still remember the first day I showed up to programming. My teacher was running late. The class door was locked, and a group of about 10 guys was standing out in the hallway. Some of them seemed disappointed that a girl was joining the class, but I assured them it was not my intention to ruin their club for very long. Haha, I suppose you can guess what happened - I broke all my promises. 

It was rather difficult at first. I didn't know how to make sense of these 1's and 0's. And a few days after I joined the class, we had a test on last year's material. I did terribly and was devastated. But I couldn't give up. There was a very very small chance the class I was waiting to start would be cancelled due to low enrollment, and I would be stuck taking programming for the rest of the term.  

Somewhere before the end of the two weeks, I realized that programming was all about breaking down ideas into logical steps to try to solve problems. Already having a love of logic and problem solving (particularly in mathematics), I soon found my stride. Also, luckily, my rival was also in the class, so I was fuel by competition. 

The compulsory course I was waiting on started, but I decided to stay in programming. I had the best time, and finished the course in 2nd place - just 2% behind my favourite opponent. 

After the course completed - I didn't think much would amount from the experience - nothing more than another fun anecdote. I was right... for a while anyways. 

Four years went by. I was nearly finished a Chemical Engineering degree at university. Then it all started - programming projects kept crossing my path (in summer jobs and my first job after uni). Most used languages I'd never learned, but I still took on each one  - teaching myself along the way. Looking back, I'm rather surprised I took on such large projects and without fear. I think I couldn't worry - I was too motivated by the challenge and the opportunity to solve big problems. 

These projects include: building a multi-user database and reporting system to manage thousands of projects and a multi-million dollar budget; creating software for scientists to model diffusion in user-defined cell cultures; re-commissioning industrial equipment in a 66 000 sqft biopharmaceutical facility; and building custom apps for laboratory management. 

Through these experiences, I've seen how custom software can change a workplace. It can automate the mundane and free employees to spend their time on more worthwhile and challenging tasks. I learned the value of a well-designed and pleasing interface for buy-in. From coding PLCs in an industrial setting, I have learned the importance of being critical of every aspect of a program. There is no subtlety too subtle - for in this industry, the slightest oversight in a program could cause someone physical harm. At the same time, a well-written program and user interface can make a world of difference for keeping an operator safe and in control. 

For me, programming is where I bring together logic, efficiency, problem solving, and creativity. Through programming, I can build tools that matter to people. Being impactful is important to me, and I'm proud of the tools I've made and those I've helped.  

The more projects I do, the more I want to do. When working, I find I'm the happiest when programming, so I decided to start learning programming more formally. Teaching myself (Googling and trying things out) has worked well, but I find learning how to program is an ever-growing jigsaw puzzle. Learning what I needed as I needed with Google allowed me to piece things together enough to get by, but I'm finding this course is adding colour to the pieces. I'm gaining a better depth of understanding for the skillset I'm building.
